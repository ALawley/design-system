These principles combined with best practices shape and guide our approach to user experience design.

## Design ethically & inclusively

#### Interview, design, and test in ways that consider and support a broad set of users and needs

### DO

- Consider how designs may unnecessarily center or exclude people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, nationality, income, political beliefs, or religious beliefs
- Protect user privacy when handling sensitive data
- Design in accordance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines v2.1
- Represent a variety of people in art, mock data, screenshots, avatars, etc.

### DON'T

- Design for an ‘average’ user or a single person
- Refer to design choices in gendered terms

## Display signal, not noise

#### Present complex data as information that is easy to interpret, easy to manipulate, and a true reflection of status

### DO

- Enable comprehension of thousands of records
- Help users who want to view Puppet data in other systems
- Use progressive disclosure to allow users to access detail at their own pace.

  </div>
  <div class="rc-column pds-width-50-percent pds-gutter">

### DON'T

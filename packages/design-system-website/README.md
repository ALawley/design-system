# Puppet Design System

## Our collective approach to increase consistency, build quickly, and deliver quality experience to our customers.

The Puppet Design System (PDS) is a collection of the common values, behaviors, components, and styles we share at Puppet. It represents our shared objective to quickly deliver value to our customers. With it we scale design across departments, platforms, and time zones.

This is built for internal use across the Puppet family of products, but others might find it useful as well.

### Getting started

Get started by cloning the repo and following the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system).

### Release notes

See the changelog at [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Contribute

The Puppet Design System is a cross-functional team effort with shared ownership. Contributions are both welcome and encouraged. Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide (and [Designing](#/Foundations/Designing) guide if applicable).

### Feedback

We are continuing to iterate on the PDS. The current focus is on internal use, but we always appreciate everyone's feedback and questions. Please [report issues](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/issues) you find or contact [puppet-design-system@puppet.com](mailto:puppet-design-system@puppet.com).

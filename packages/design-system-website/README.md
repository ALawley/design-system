## Our collective approach to increase consistency, build quickly,  and deliver quality experience to our customers. 
This is a collection of the common values, behaviors, components, and styles we share at Puppet. It represents our shared objective to quickly deliver value to our customers. With it we scale design across departments, platforms, and time zones.

For background, see [Puppet Design System](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/PDS) on Confluence or watch the [Big Picture presentation](https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/events/playback/33fcd61c-3ad2-4413-9393-cc216551d61b) .

### Getting started
**Designers** should download and install the Sketch library. Instructions for installation and receiving updates are on Confluence.

**Developers** can get started by cloning the repo and following the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system).

**Writers**, should start with the [writing guidelines](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/Writing/Puppet+content+style+guide). These are helpful for anyone creating content, from full pages to micro-copy.

### Contribute
The Puppet Design System is a cross-functional team effort with shared ownership. Contributions are both welcome and encouraged.  We have written a [best-practices guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/wiki) to help you get started.

Developers should start with the the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repo. Designers should reference the [design criteria for adding symbols and styles](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/wiki/Design-criteria) to the Sketch library.

### Feedback
We are continuing to iterate on the PDS, and appreciate your feedback and questions. Say hi Slack in the [#team-design-system](https://puppet.slack.com/messages/CFFECRQAY) channel, contact [puppet-design-system@puppet.com](mailto:puppet-design-system@puppet.com) or [report an issue](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=16902&issuetype=1&priority=6) in Jira (the “PDS” project).

### Release Notes
We’ve most recently simplified the site, combining content from the Sketch-based style guide, with the react-library. Our hope is to make the site easier to navigate, with much more thorough documentation.

* Simplified the site to be purely based on styleguidist.
* New content template, with documentation pulled directly from the repo.
* Moved to GitHub pages to simplify and automate deployment of the site.
* Updated documentation for multiple components.

You can also see the changelog for each package, like react-components’ at [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/design-system/blob/master/packages/react-components/CHANGELOG.md).

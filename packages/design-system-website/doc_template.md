## Overview

This section should contain the description and intent of the component. This is generally a combination of the styleguide docs and API docs. Make sure to call out states or anything to look out for in the sections below. Reference the [Button](#/React%20Components/Button) component as an example.

Over-arching dev (or design) instructions can live in this section. Depending on the situation, it might be appropriate to add any specific instructions in a separate section below the Overview.

At the end of this section, include a selective group of directly relevant links, as such - See also: [Button](#/React%20Components/Button) and [Text](#/React%20Components/Text).

### Optional section

Depending on the situation, it might be appropriate to add another section below the Overview to dive deeper into specifics. The title of this section will vary depending on the content that lives here. 

## Type

_(This section contains component examples, ordered by the visual variants of primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. Start with the main visual variant as the primary example.)_

### Primary

Primary example description goes here.

```jsx
Followed by the primary example.
```

## Basic Use
_(If the component does not contain visual variants, or if the primary/second/tert model doesn't work, use this header instead.)_

## Variations
_(This section generally pertains to different expressions of the basic component. Not all components will require this section. Reference the [Button](#/React%20Components/Button) and [Text](#/React%20Components/Text) components.)_

### Name of variant #1

Variant #1 description goes here.

```jsx
Followed by the example.
```

### Name of variant #2

## Overview
###### Sketch symbol: puppet-ui-library / Text

The text component is a foundational element that provides an encapsulated way to use typography, consistent with design system rules. Together the `size` and `color` props determine the rendered typographical variant.

Our products use three font families, with their various weights and sizes, to communicate clearly with our users. Donâ€™t introduce new typographic styles to our products without consulting the UX team.

Design specifications can be found in the [Styleguide](packages/design-assets/puppet-styleguide.sketch).

## Type
### Font Families
* <strong>Calibre</strong>: Headlines, titles, navigation, visualizations, and other primary elements
* <strong>Open Sans</strong>: Body copy and general UI elements and content
* <strong>Inconsolata</strong>: Code samples

### Text Colors
Take into account expected behavior and accessibility guidelines when using text colors. 

#### Neutral Colors
These colors are used for the majority of text. They are defined as Base (default), Medium, and Subtle.

```jsx
<Text><strong>Base</strong> (Neutral 900): This is the darkest and the most commonly used.</Text>
<Text color="medium"><strong>Medium</strong> (Neutral 700): This is used to reduce emphasis on text.</Text>
<Text color="subtle"><strong>Subtle</strong> (Neutral 600): This further reduces emphasis and is reserved for asides and supplemental information. Use for heading styles Heading 5 and larger.</Text>
```

#### Stoplight Colors
Our "stoplight" colors are reserved to apply meaning, or state, within a given context. Use these for the text component (Body, Small, Tiny). They are defined as Success, Danger, and Warning.

```jsx
<Text color="success"><strong>Success</strong>(Green 700): Used to communicate a successful operation or general approval.</Text>
<Text color="danger"><strong>Danger</strong>(Yellow 600): This communicates a dangerous, irrecoverable action or failure of some kind.</Text>
<Text color="warning"><strong>Warning</strong>(Red 600): This is used to call attention to specific information or to provide a warning. Can also be used to convey an unknown state IF that could be problematic for the user.</Text>
```

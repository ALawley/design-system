A `Card` component displays site content in a manner similar to a playing card, it help set out one bit of information from the other.

This component is built using the Card component from Semantic UI. Therefore much of the API is the same as [here](https://react.semantic-ui.com/views/card).

Note: The card component will take up 100% of the width of its parent, such as if contained in Semantic-UI's [grid layout system](https://react.semantic-ui.com/collections/grid).
